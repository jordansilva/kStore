Android Shoppable App
Your assignment is to create a small scale shopping app, please use Kotlin!

### Goal
✅ The app should be able to present a range of products and allow the user to add them to a Cart.

### Data
We have attached a products.json file as input.
✅ The file contains a list of products of two types, "chair" and "couch", and additional data like picture, name, price etc.

## Screens

### List of Products
✅ Use the product data to visualize the products in a user friendly way.

### Product Detail
✅ Notice there are differences in what "info" is provided for a "chair" vs a "couch".
✅ We still want this data to be available to the end user, ex. a "chair" has "material" and a "coach" has "numberOfSeats".

### Cart
    ✅ - Products shall be possible to add to a Cart (a shopping list).
    - The Cart should display all added products.
      - Each product should display it's price but the cart should also display the total price for all products.
    - User's change their minds, please add support to remove a product from the Cart :)

Have fun and enjoy!


---------

### Assumptions
- All products retrieved will have the same currency, otherwise the app should have a way to convert different currencies to a selected one to present in the cart.
